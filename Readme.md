LowProfile.Fourier
==================

This repository contains code for performing the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). The solution contains the following:

* Single and double precision FFT code in C#.
* Templated C++ FFT code (for single and double precision operations).
* Binding for [KissFFT](http://kissfft.sourceforge.net/).
* Simple unit test harness.
* Simple performance test harness.

The code can be freely used and is public domain. You are free to use this code in any way you want, but I take make no guarantees about its safety, correctness or fitness for a specific task. Use at your own risk.
